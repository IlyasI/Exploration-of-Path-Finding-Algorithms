# Exploration of Path Finding Algorithms

Exploration of Best-First (Greedy), Dijkstra's, A*, and Theta* path finding algorithm performance in a known environment.
Various heuristics are tested in conjuction with these algorithms, including euclidean, octile, and manhattan distance.

The final report is provided in [Path_Finding_Report.pdf](https://github.com/IlyasI/Exploration-of-Path-Finding-Algorithms/blob/master/Path_Finding_Report.pdf).
